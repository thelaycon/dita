			<title>What are static websites?</title>

			<p>Static websites are websites that do not rely explicitly on servers. Contents of static websites are not dynamically generated by servers but are rather a collection of predefined pages. The advantage of static websites over dynamic websites is the speed they offer to users and the ease of setup and deployment they offer to developers.</p>

			<p>Given that Web Developers often begin their journey with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript with which static websites are built, they can start building websites without knowing serverside technologies.</p>

			<title>Purpose of Hugo</title>

			<p>Hugo allows users to manage static websites efficiently by providing them with useful commands that can be used to create, edit, and delete content with ease. It can be called a CMS for static websites. 
		With Hugo, static websites can be managed with single or multiple commands without tempering with the existing design and configurations of websites.</p> 
			<p>In addition, Hugo has a repository of beautiful themes that can be customised to suit your needs. The community is vibrant, hence new themes both free and premium ones are published regularly.</p>
